My process

- Since I'm currently working on getting the hang of CSS Grid module, I saw this challenge fit to try out the knowledge I've gathered about Grid.
- It wasn't easy, as expected but I sure have gained some experiences to have bettered myself on working with CSS grid.   

Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


Continued development

Still got some work to do as far as CSS Grid is concerned though, but then I love that I finally have put the little I,ve known to practice. I know I'll only get better going forward.
